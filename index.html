        <p id="personalinfo">The Hui people are an East Asian ethnoreligious group predominantly composed of ethnically Sinitic adherents of the Muslim faith in China. The three movies we are going to look at today all portray Hui people's perception about life, relationships and family involving with the theme of death.

The first film, Tasbih, is directed by a group of Muslim young graduates from Beijing Film Academy, the largest institution specializing in the higher education for film and television production in Asia. It tells the story of a Hui nationality old man who spent more than seven years after his wife passed way in looking for a missing Tasbih to help her "reborn." In the movie, he recalled how he met and fell in love with his wife, and how he made and gave the Tasbih to her. Although he did not find the missing Tasbih after getting thousands of similar ones, he realized his deep affection for his wife, and passed away peacefully to follow the steps of his wife.

The second movie, Knife in the Clear Water, is produced based on an award-winning novel. It depicted the story of an aging Hui Muslim farmer after his wife passed away. He and his family eke out an existence farming on an arid moonscape in China's northwest Ningxia province. Forty days after his wife dies, Ma must perform a memorial service and invite his village neighbors to a feast. He and his son made a difficult decision to sacrifice their aging cow for the service. The cow, after seeing the reflection of knife in the clear water, knew its fate of death and stopped eating and drinking to keep it clean enough to be sacrificed. Old Ma tenderly cares for the animal, washing it and attempting to feed it; perhaps he sees something of himself in the loyal old beast. Both of them are approaching the end of their natural lifespans, as is the hardscrabble way of life that characterizes their village. 

The third movie Jade King: History of a Chinese Muslim family, is also based on a renowned award-winning novel. It tells the story of three generations in a Hui Muslim family through the turbulent years the Japanese Invasion to the present day. The theme of this tragic novel are the tangled and complicated love stories of father, son, aunt and daughter, all being victims of prejudice and fate.
The story begins with a poor but talented jade craftsman surnamed Liang, who has but one regret in life-he has no son and heir to carry on the family business. One day, a venerable old Muslim on his way to Mecca and accompanied by his young disciple Abraham appears at Liang's door to ask for sustenance. Entranced by Liang's exquisite jade work and his two beautiful daughters, Abraham begs to be allowed to stay and learn how to make jade crafts. Mr. Liang gave him a Chinese name based on his original name Abraham. He fell in love with the elder sister and married her later. However, as Japan harshly invaded China in World War Two, Abraham was separated from his wife and son when he was escaping to London, while he incidentally met the younger sister. The kinship turns to romance as they depended on each other in a foreign country, and they had a daughter. After the war was over, the family reunited but the elder sister was unhappy about what her husband and sister did. The younger sister agreed to leave, and the elder sister raised the daughter up. The daughter fell in love with her non-Muslim teacher after she grew up, but her family was against that relationships because Muslim women are not supposed to marry non-Muslim men. As she was very sad about the future of the relationships, she accidentally knew how she was born and her real mother. While her mother was pregnant, since she had to hide from people's eyes, the Embryo was not well preserved that the daughter had Cardiovascular disease. As she was shocked and sad, she suddenly passed away at the age of 21 while her real mother did not know. Her birth mother, the younger sister, came to Abraham's home ten years later, trying to tell her daughter about everything but only being informed that her daughter had passed away.

          <h3 class="designstatement">Intended audience</h3>
          <p>I would like my personal website to be a showcase of my works including my internship experiences, articles written by me, videos produced by me and any other projects that I have done to increase my chances of being hired. In this essay, I’m going to analyze my audience for the site, strategies on what I’m going to present on the site and how I should tell my stories to my audience in order to successfully deliver my message. 
            I would target my primary audience recruiters. I would like my secondary audience to be practitioners in the field and alumni.

          <h3 class="designstatement">Insights</h3>
          <p>I interviewed three people on how to build up my website. They are Pam Luecke, Professor of Journalism & Mass Communications and Internship Coordinator, Jeffrey Barry, Associate Professor and Associate University Librarian, and Alison Yeung, Associate Director of Corporate Communications, China Everbright Limited. I agree with Professor Luecke’s idea of putting multimedia content on my website and I like the idea of putting a map on my about page. I even think further that I can put an interactive map that integrates my experiences, photos and projects as my audience clicking on different places I’ve been to. In the meantime, I should keep in mind Professor Barry’s suggestion that I should not make my website too busy – multimedia contents are important, but they should not distract my audience from concentrating on my works. Before I start to design the website, I should make sure my theme is consistent and effectively demonstrate my personalities and skills needed by employers. Last but not least, I agree with Alison that I need to demonstrate some transferable skills from my projects to show that I’m a good communication professional no matter which places I go. In addition, communication skills are also significant to other occupations, so highlighting my communication skills will help me open the door for different employment opportunities.</p>
